# Diabetes Risk Prediction Using Deep Learning

<p> As part of its health-tech expansion, we are exploring AI-driven preventive healthcare tools our goal is to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using Deep Learning models on medical attributes, helping practitioners take proactive actions. <p/>

• Data pre-processing and cleaning for each dataset. <br>
• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python(Jupiter notebook) and Numpy, Matplot Lib, Seaborn.<br>
•	Implementation of deep learning model like DNN.<br>
•	Evaluating models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.<br>

# Results and Conclusion

## DNN Model Creation
